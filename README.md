# AI Metaphors & Moments

This repository collects short, powerful insights, metaphors, and cultural analogies about AI and GPT systems â€” inspired by everyday moments, classic media, and modern chaos.

Each file is a self-contained idea that could stand alone as a:
- ðŸ”¹ LinkedIn post  
- ðŸ“š Teaching example  
- ðŸ§  Conversation starter  
- ðŸ’¡ Future writing seed  

These are not technical papers â€” theyâ€™re reflections and analogies meant to help people *feel* and *understand* AI, not just analyze it.

## Why This Exists

Sometimes the best way to explain a runaway language modelâ€¦  
is to talk about enchanted brooms in *Fantasia*.

This repo is a living notebook of those connections â€” captured before theyâ€™re forgotten, and shared in case they help others frame their own thoughts.

## Topics (so far)

- `01_fantasia-gpt-metaphor.md`: Mickey, GPT, and the Broom Apocalypse  
*(Why AI alignment feels like 1940s animation)*

More to come.

Let me know if you want a slightly more academic tone or a more humorous spin (e.g., "GPT Fables: Talking Parrots, Broom Armies, and Other Misfires").
