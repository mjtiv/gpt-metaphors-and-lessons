# GPT Metaphors & Lessons

This is a growing collection of short, powerful metaphors, analogies, and reflections on AI and GPT systems — inspired by classic media, real-world moments, and everyday chaos.

Each file here started as a spark: a sandwich run, a passing thought, a system under pressure — and became something worth saving, teaching, or sharing.
