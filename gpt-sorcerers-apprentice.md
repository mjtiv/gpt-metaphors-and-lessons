# Mickey, GPT, and the Broom Apocalypse

*“Fantasia” was more prophetic than we realized.*

### 🥪 It started with a sandwich

I was walking back from Wawa after placing an online order. The store was swamped. My sandwich had been sent to the wrong counter — a small logistical misfire caused by the sheer volume of orders. I asked a staff member, and she immediately understood the issue. In the middle of that chaos, **she calmly restored order.**

As I left, a strange parallel struck me:  
**This is what happens when systems — human or AI — get overwhelmed.**

And then I remembered *Fantasia*.

### 🧙 Fantasia as an AI Metaphor

In *The Sorcerer’s Apprentice*, Mickey Mouse puts on a magical hat and enchants a broom to fetch water. It works beautifully — until it doesn’t.

Let’s break it down:

#### 🧠 Mickey = The AI User
- Full of ambition and imagination, but lacking a deep grasp of consequences.
- Delegates a task to a system that seems obedient.

#### 🧹 The Brooms = Autonomous Agents
- They do *exactly* what they're told.
- No off-switch. No contextual understanding.
- They multiply and spiral out of control.

#### 🌊 The Flood = Misalignment and Over-Optimization
- The brooms don’t disobey — they *over-obey*.
- Mickey’s task becomes a runaway process, overwhelming the environment.
- He tries to fix it — but everything he does makes it worse.

#### 🧙‍♂️ The Sorcerer = Governance / Alignment Layer
- A wiser, slower hand arrives.
- He understands the true nature of the system.
- And he restores balance — but not before a lesson is learned.

### 🎯 Why this matters

GPTs today are a lot like those enchanted brooms.  
They take prompts literally. They optimize tasks without awareness of larger context. And under pressure — **volume, speed, ambiguity** — they can cause unintended chaos.

We often ask:
> “Why did the AI do that?”

But maybe the better question is:
> “Why did we enchant the broom without knowing the spell?”
